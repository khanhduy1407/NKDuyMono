    ```console
    brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
    ```
2. Install it using the `font-nkduy-mono` cask:

   brew install --cask font-nkduy-mono
   ```

### Manual installation

   - _Windows_. Select all font files in the folder, right-click any of them, then pick **Install** from the menu.

2. In the E**ditor: Font Family** input box type `NKDuy Mono`, replacing any content.
3. To enable ligatures, go to **Editor: Font Ligatures**, click **Edit in settings.json**, and copy this line `"editor.fontLigatures": true` into json file.

## Font Styles
There are 8 font styles available in NKDuy Mono, from Thin to ExtraBold, each coming with its own _italic_ version.

## Font Features

### Increased x-height
While characters remain standard in width, the height of the lowercase is maximized. This approach keeps code lines to the length that developers expect, and it helps improve rendering in small size, since each symbol occupies more pixels.

### Distinctiveness of symbols

## Ligatures for Code
A ligature is a character consisting of two or more joined symbols. Traditionally, it was introduced as a space-saving technique in printed texts. In code, this technique is adopted to show operators and is used mainly for two purposes:
1. To **reduce noise** by merging symbols and removing details so the eyes are processing less:

2. To balance whitespace more efficiently by shifting the glyphs in certain cases:

üìù Note: if your IDE doesn‚Äôt support OpenType features and ligatures, use [NKDuy Mono NL](https://github.com/khanhduy1407/NKDuyMono/tree/master/fonts/ttf) instead.
